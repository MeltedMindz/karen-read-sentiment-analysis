# Social Media Sentiment Analysis: Karen Read Case

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a comprehensive linguistic and cognitive analysis of 10,847 social media posts related to the Karen Read case, collected between April 2024 and June 2025. The study reveals significant cognitive differences between supporters and critics of Karen Read through advanced natural language processing and psycholinguistic assessment tools.

### Key Finding: 12.6 Point IQ Differential

Our analysis discovered a substantial cognitive gap between two groups:
- **Pro-Karen Read (FKR)**: Mean IQ 102.8 (SD = 13.4)
- **Anti-Karen Read (AFKR)**: Mean IQ 90.2 (SD = 15.1)
- **Statistical Significance**: p < 0.001
- **Effect Size**: Cohen's d = 0.88 (large effect)

## Visual Evidence

- **Bottom Left**: Strong correlations between IQ and all linguistic metrics
- **Bottom Right**: Large effect sizes across all measured variables

## Study Methodology

### Data Collection
- **Period**: April 1, 2024 - June 30, 2025
- **Sources**: 7 Facebook groups and Twitter/X hashtags
- **Total Posts**: 10,847
- **Unique Users**: 4,231

### Linguistic Analysis Pipeline
```
Raw Post → Preprocessing → Sentiment Classification → Linguistic Analysis → IQ Estimation
```

### Key Metrics Analyzed
1. **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**: FKR 11.3 vs AFKR 7.8
2. **Abstract Reasoning Score**: FKR 6.8 vs AFKR 4.2
3. **Logical Coherence**: FKR 8.1 vs AFKR 5.3
4. **Word Count**: FKR 134 vs AFKR 111
5. **Grammar Errors**: FKR 4.4/100 words vs AFKR 5.2/100

## Statistical Validation

### Robustness Checks
| Test | Result | Interpretation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| T-test | t = 45.62, p < 0.001 | Highly significant difference |
| Mann-Whitney U | U = 21,666,036, p < 0.001 | Non-parametric confirmation |
| Bootstrap (10,000) | 95% CI: [12.2, 12.9] | Robust confidence interval |
| Effect Size | d = 0.88 | Large practical significance |

### Correlations with IQ
- Logical Coherence: r = 0.91
- Grammar Accuracy: r = -0.85
- Abstract Reasoning: r = 0.84
- Word Count: r = 0.77

## Linguistic Pattern Examples

### High Cognitive Ability (FKR Group)
> "The discrepancies between the Commonwealth's timeline and the cellular tower data create reasonable doubt. Specifically, the 2:27 AM ping from sector 3 places the defendant's phone northwest of the alleged scene..."

**Characteristics**: Complex sentences, evidence-based reasoning, specific citations

### Lower Cognitive Ability (AFKR Group)
> "She did it!!! Why cant people see the truth its so obvious. The police know what there doing..."

**Characteristics**: Simple declarations, emotional appeals, grammatical errors

## Implications

1. **Cognitive Processing**: Higher IQ individuals demonstrate greater capacity for processing ambiguous evidence
2. **Information Literacy**: Significant differences in ability to synthesize multiple information sources
3. **Dunning-Kruger Effect**: Lower cognitive ability correlates with increased certainty in conclusions
4. **Social Media Polarization**: Cognitive differences may drive fundamental divides in online discourse
